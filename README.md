# SeqDis_EnzymeKinetic

This repository contains code and resources related to a research study focused on sequential optimal designs for discriminating enzyme kinetic profiles. The paper investigates the challenges associated with optimal designs for discriminating between different enzyme kinetic profiles. One significant challenge is the dependence of optimal designs on the true model and its associated parameters. To address this issue, the study explores various sequential design strategies, with a particular emphasis on T-, Ds-, and Î´-optimality. This paper is published in the Proceedings of the 63rd ISI World Statistics Congress (link: https://www.isi-web.org/files/docs/papers-and-abstracts/133-day3-cps013-a-comparison-of-sequential-des.pdf).
